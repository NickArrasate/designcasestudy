          While attending Epicodus, I was asked to take on a project to redesign a placeholder site meant to showcase an inventory control and ordering program. I saw this project as a great opportunity to get real world design experience and fulfill some of the requirements for Epicodusâ€™ Design course.

          The client was approaching a ready-to-ship verion of their software
          and the time had come to give the interface and experience a facelift. They had previously been using a very basic HTML-only site to test the program.

          The main purpose of this project was to give Food Methods an easy way to showcase their product to prospective customers.

          While the client had no hard timeline, I was able to meet all
          deadlines at Epicodus. I also did not charge for this project.
