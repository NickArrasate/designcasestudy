        The goal for this project was to redesign a dummy site that would allow Food Methods to showcase their underlying ordering and inventory control software. I wanted it to be simple and modular so potential customers could easily see how their actual products would populate the site and get inspiration for how any custom buildouts might look when complete. Because the client needs to be able to show his customers the power of his software in an elegant and easy to understand way, I gave the project a somewhat minimal aesthetic with an easy to follow flow.

        While this was largely an overhaul of an existing site, I feel I was able to add a lot of usability and greatly improve the ability of my client to let their tech speak for itself.
