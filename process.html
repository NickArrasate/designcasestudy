      <h4>User Stories and Personas</h4>
      <p>
        We know exactly who the target audience is for this site. The site will cater to small entrepreneurs in the food industry. I wrote several User Stories and Personas for the client to review. I walked each
        through various uses of the site and had the client review them.

      <h4>Dynamic Prototypes</h4>
      <p>
        I used Sketch+InVision to create a Dynamic Protoype so my client could interact with the site as if it had already been coded. This allowed the client a chance to give feedback on user flow and further refine our objectives.

      <h4>Working with The Client</h4>
      <p>
        The client and I were able to keep lines of communication wide open during the process. This allowed us to bounce ideas back and forth and refine the product as it got closer to completion.
