      "Nick Arrasate has been working on a web application project for Food Methods.
We’ve been very pleased with the design ideas Nick has created. His layouts fit well with our brand identity.
The result is a product that we’re proud to present to clients. Nick’s attention to detail has helped give the site a very refined look and feel. We’re very happy with the work Nick has done. And we hope he is available when we start our next project."<br><br> - David Hill, Founder and CEO of Food Methods Inc.
